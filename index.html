<h1>My Main Hobby</h1>
<p>My Favourite Hobby is Playing Music. It's my favourite thing to do, other than Watching TV ðŸ˜‰. Music calms your body and soothens your mind. It keeps you relaxed. There are different types of Music, and everybody loves at least some genre of it. My Father was the one who introduced me to Music. He got me a Keyboard when I was 5 years old and that was how one of my hobbies became Music. They are also lots of...no, thousands of Musicians around the world so it's something that everyone loves doing. My dream is to become a Musician when I grow up, and I hope I will on of the most famous ones.<p>

<h4>The image below is of Beethoven! I don't really have an inspiration, because I started Music since my father bought me a keyboard. Beethoven was a very talented Musician. I think this because although he was deaf, he still created wonderful songs.</h4>
